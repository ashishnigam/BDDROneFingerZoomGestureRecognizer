 * \brief \c UIGestureRecognizer subclass to enable one-finger-zoom gestures.
 * \details \c BDDROneFingerZoomGestureRecognizer is a concrete subclass of \c UIGestureRecognizer that looks for long-press gestures
 * followed by a move with one finger to calculate a scale factor. When the user moves the finger towards the bottom screen edge, the conventional
 * meaning is zoom-out; when the user moves the finger towards the top screen edge, the conventional meaning is zoom-in.
 * \details One-finger-zoom gestures are continuous. The gesture begins (\c UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan) when one finger taps the specified
 * amount of times (\c numberOfTapsRequired), has been pressed for the specified period (\c minimumPressDuration) while not moving beyond the
 * allowable range of movement (\c allowableMovement), and then moves. The gesture changes (\c UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged) whenever the finger
 * moves, and it ends (\c UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded) when the finger is lifted.
